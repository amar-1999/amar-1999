# 👋 Hi, I'm Damarakeswar

## 🚀 Frontend Engineer | React Wizard 🧙 | UI/UX Whisperer | CSS Battle Champion (Unofficial)

Hi, I’m Damarakeswar — a pixel-perfectionist who builds clean, scalable, and buttery-smooth UIs powered by **React**, **Tailwind**, and **Ant Design** (yeah, I speak Fluent Ant). 💅

### 🛠️ What I Do
- 🧱 Build dashboards with complex responsive layouts (Sidebar + Navbar combos that don’t break on mobile 👀)
- ⚙️ Create **custom component libraries** — because generic buttons just don’t cut it
- 📂 Implement **Excel + CSV export logic** for financial workflows (payouts by RTGS/NEFT/Internal Transfer, anyone?)
- 🌩️ Integrate with **AWS S3** like a boss (uploading, fetching, managing)
- 🎨 Style with **Tailwind**, fine-tune with **media queries**, and polish with **Google Fonts** (because branding matters)

### 🧠 When I’m Not Coding

- Fixing a font-size bug that turned `<Input />` into `<IMAX />`
- Wondering why `@apply font-poppins` didn’t work
- Asking **JARVIS** (my AI sidekick) for layout hacks or dev wisdom  
- Or building something cool with ⚛️ just because I can

---

### 🎯 Currently

- Working with a solid product team (startup vibes, maybe?)
- Writing code that’s not just functional, but *elegant*
- Probably making a `<Form />` right now
